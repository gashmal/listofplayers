# listofplayers

## Installation and usage

I made the app on a linux computer and don't have access to a mac at the moment. So it is untested on iOS.

### Running the project

Clone this repository :

```
https://github.com/gashmal/listofplayers.git
```

Install packages :

```
yarn
```

When installation is complete, build the app :
```
yarn android
```

and run it :

```
yarn start
```
